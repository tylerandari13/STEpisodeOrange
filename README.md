# STEpisodeOrange
 An addon for [SuperTux](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/).

# How to use:
**As of currently you will need to install a special build of SuperTux to use Episode Orange.**

* Download [this build of SuperTux](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/actions/runs/3697107500) that has Resource packs via the artifacts.

* Download this addon as a `.zip`

* Go to `%appdata%/supertux2/addons` and put the zip file in.

Once the addon is in and enabled you need to restart SuperTux for the changes to take effect.
Keep in mind the resource pack build was made on 0.6.3 while the new player sprites will be made for 0.7.0 (which will also have texture packs). This will cause some visual glitches so be warned.

**Alternatively you could:**

* It is preferred you use a nightly build but it is not required at the moment.

* Make a new folder somewhere. (can be anywhere you can get the path for)

* Copy the path to this folder. (will refer to this path as `<EpisodeOrange>` in future steps)

* Extract Episode Orange in this folder.

* Go to wherever your supertux application is. (If you installed with the defaults it should be in `C:\Program Files\SuperTux\bin` for the 64-bit version of the game or `C:\Program Files (x86)\SuperTux\bin` for the 32-bit version of the game)

* Type `cmd` in the path bar up at the top to open the command line.

* Run the command `supertux2 --userdir <EpisodeOrange>` with `<EpisodeOrange>` being the path refered to earlier.

If you followed the steps correctly you should be able to use this version of Episode Orange.
